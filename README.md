# Question: How do you implement a function to find the majority element in an array? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided defines a function named `findMajorityElement` that is designed to identify the majority element in an array, if one exists. The function works by creating an empty object, `countMap`, which is used to store the count of each element in the array. It also initializes two variables, `majorityElement` and `majorityCount`, to keep track of the current majority element and its count. The function then iterates over the array, incrementing the count of each element in `countMap` and updating `majorityElement` and `majorityCount` whenever it finds an element with a higher count. After the iteration, the function checks if the count of the `majorityElement` is greater than half the length of the array. If it is, the function returns the `majorityElement`; otherwise, it returns `null`. The function is then tested with several example arrays to demonstrate its functionality.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of logic and approach. Both versions use a map to count the occurrences of each element in the array and then find the element that occurs more than half the length of the array. However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. TypeScript uses static types: In the TypeScript version, the `findMajorityElement` method is explicitly typed to take an array of numbers as input and return either a number or null. This provides type safety and can help prevent type-related bugs.

2. TypeScript uses a `Map` instead of an object: The TypeScript version uses a `Map` to count the occurrences of each number, while the JavaScript version uses a plain object. A `Map` in TypeScript (and modern JavaScript) is an ordered list of key-value pairs, which can offer better performance and more predictable behavior than an object when used as a hash map.

3. TypeScript uses the `for...of` loop: The TypeScript version uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array and the entries in the `Map`, which can be more readable and easier to work with than the traditional `for` loop used in the JavaScript version.

4. TypeScript uses a class: The TypeScript version defines a `MajorityElementFinder` class with a `findMajorityElement` method, while the JavaScript version defines a standalone function. This can make the TypeScript version more modular and easier to integrate into larger, object-oriented codebases.

5. TypeScript uses the non-null assertion operator: The TypeScript version uses the non-null assertion operator (`!`) to assert that the value returned by `countMap.get(num)` is not null or undefined. This is necessary because the `get` method of a `Map` can potentially return `undefined` if the key does not exist in the map, but in this case, we know that the key exists because we just checked it with `countMap.has(num)`.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version. Both versions use a map to count the occurrences of each element in the array and then find the element with the highest count. However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of C++ and JavaScript.

1. Data Structures: In JavaScript, an object is used as a map to store the counts of each element. In C++, an unordered_map is used for the same purpose. 

2. Looping: In JavaScript, a for loop is used to iterate over the array. In C++, a range-based for loop is used, which is a feature not available in JavaScript.

3. Variable Declaration: In JavaScript, variables are declared with `let` keyword. In C++, variables are declared with their data types such as `int` for integers and `std::vector<int>` for an array of integers.

4. Incrementing Counts: In JavaScript, the count of an element is incremented after checking if the element exists in the map. In C++, the count is incremented while checking the condition in the if statement using the `++` operator before the variable.

5. Finding Majority Element: In JavaScript, the majority element is found and returned in the same loop where the counts are incremented. In C++, after finding the highest count, another loop is used to find and return the element with that count.

6. Return Value: If no majority element is found, the JavaScript version returns `null`, while the C++ version returns `-1`.

7. Output: In JavaScript, the result is printed to the console using `console.log()`. In C++, the result is printed using `std::cout`.

8. Main Function: In C++, the code is wrapped in a `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. JavaScript doesn't require a main function.
